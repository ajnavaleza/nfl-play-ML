# üèà Expected Yards & Play Calling Intelligence System

An ML-powered web application that predicts expected yards gained for various play types and recommends optimal offensive plays based on down, distance, field position, and defense tendencies.

## Description

This system can help offensive coordinators and analysts evaluate play-calling effectiveness, simulate decisions in critical game scenarios, and create data-informed game plans tailored to specific opponents.

## Features

- **Expected Yards Prediction**: ML model predicting yards gained based on game context
- **Play Recommendation System**: Intelligent suggestions for optimal play types
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time simulation and visualization
- **Opponent Analysis**: Customizable analysis based on defensive tendencies
- **Model Explainability**: SHAP values showing key factors influencing predictions
- **Game Scenario Simulator**: Test different play calling strategies

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, XGBoost, scikit-learn
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Seaborn
- **Data**: NFL play-by-play data (nflfastR format)
- **ML Explainability**: SHAP
